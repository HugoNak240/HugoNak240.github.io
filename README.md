## Summary
  A well structured and functioning Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a valuable asset to application development. The static files for this github pages website are integrated from the 'Website' repository (repo). This repo exists as a submodule in 'Website/HugoPort/public'. Two separate yet connected repos allow for a simple and effective CI/CD pipeline. https://hugonak240.github.io/
